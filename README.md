# Jessy
Jessy is a digital workspace for students ard professionals to organize their life in one place. Available at [jessy.app](https://jessy.app).

# Application Architecture
Jessy can be used with many modular extensions (tools like Tasks, Music, etc.) that leverage the underlying Project-Board-Extension architecture. Projects are the top level folders that have Boards as subfolders. Boards contain Extension-specific data, that can be cross-shared between other Extensions. This means that you can reference a task from the Tasks extension in your Notes extension, and so on.

# Extensions
## Tasks ([@diragb](https://github.com/diragb))
Currently WIP, **Tasks** lets you manage tasks. This currently does not leverage the PBE.

## Music ([@Sharan420](https://github.com/Sharan420))
Currently WIP, **Music** lets you play any song or playlist from Apple Music, SoundCloud, Spotify, or any other source.
